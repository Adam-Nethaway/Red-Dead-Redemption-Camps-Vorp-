# Red-Dead-Redemption-Camps-Vorp-

This script is meant to work with VorpCore.

You MUST add the "tent" to the database for this to work. When the tent is added, all you need to do is click the tent in the inventory and it will place it on the ground in front of you. 

After the tent is placed you do the command /place to place objects in your camp (See Config.lua to add or delete objects from the list.).

Command example: -- /place chair 1 -- chair being the object and the number being the variant in the list.

While placing an object, "[",will rotate left "]" will rotate right, "F" will place the object.

/delete will delete the last placed object (when the last placed object is deleted, it will make the one before that the "last placed object.)

/packtent will pack the tent and delete all the objects you placed and add the tent back to the inventory.
